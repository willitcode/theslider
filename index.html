        <h1>The Slider</h1>
        <p>Have you ever had a friend ask you a yes or no question, but you answer isn't quite "yes" or "no?" Then The Slider is for you! Simply slide The Slider to your desired answer, hit copy link<!--or download the image-->, and send it off to your friend!</p>
        <p>If you've just been sent this page, you've likely asked your friend a yes or no question with an answer that isn't quite yes or no. If so, look below for your friend's answer. (Don't move the slider thoughâ€”you'll lose your friend's answer!)</p>
